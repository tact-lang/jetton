# Jetton (Fungible Token) Implementation in Tact

![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Work_In_Progress-Do%20not%20use%20in%20production%20yet-red?style=for-the-badge)

# **This will definitely be a stable version of Jettons, but not for now. Please, do not use this code in production. It might have some bugs.**

## Overview

This project includes a complete setup for working with Tact-based Jetton smart contracts. It provides:

- A pre-configured Tact compiler.
- Smart contracts written in the Tact language.
- TypeScript + Jest testing environment with `@ton/sandbox`.

## Goals

This implementation is fully compatible with the following TON standards:

- [TEP-64](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md),
- [TEP-74](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md),
- [TEP-89](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0089-jetton-wallet-discovery.md).

You can use this implementation as an alternative to the reference Jetton contracts available in the [TON Blockchain repository](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract).

## Improvements and additional features

This implementation also includes new features, that will allow developers and users on TON to easier integrate and work with Jettons in their applications

### Balance on-chain API

This additional receiver provides functionality similar to [TEP-89](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0089-jetton-wallet-discovery.md), but with wallet balance. You can request and then receive balance from any Jetton wallet with possible additional info for transaction verification

#### Transaction scheme

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as Any Account
    participant C as Jetton Wallet

    D ->>+ C: ProvideWalletBalance<BR />(0x7ac8d559)
    C ->>+ D: TakeWalletBalance<BR />(0xca77fdc2)
```

#### TLB

```tlb
provide_wallet_balance#7ac8d559 receiver:MsgAddress include_verify_info:Bool = InternalMsgBody;

verify_info$_ owner:MsgAddress minter:MsgAddress code:^Cell = VerifyInfo;
take_wallet_balance#ca77fdc2 balance:Coins verify_info:(Maybe VerifyInfo) = InternalMsgBody;
```

### Claim TON from Jetton Wallet/Minter

These receivers both on Jetton Wallet and Jetton Minter allow to claim stale TON coins from contracts, leaving just enough balance for them to not freeze and function properly. Message body includes `receiver` field, that allows to specify funds receiver

#### Transaction scheme

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as Owner
    participant C as Jetton Wallet/Minter
    participant F as msg.receiver

    D ->>+ C: ClaimTON<BR />(0x0393b1ce)
    C ->>+ F: TON's<BR />(empty body)
```

#### TLB

```tlb
claim_ton#0393b1ce receiver:MsgAddress = InternalMsgBody;
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Build Contracts

Compile the smart contracts with:

```bash
yarn build
```

### 3. Deploy Contracts

Customize your Jetton by editing the `contract.deploy.ts` file. This file also includes a detailed deployment guide. Deploy the contracts with:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

### 4. Test Contracts

Run tests in the `@ton/sandbox` environment:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Jetton Architecture

If you’re new to Jettons, read the [TON Jettons Processing](https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/asset-processing/jettons).

## Project Structure

Smart contracts, their tests, and the deployment script are located in the `src` directory:

```
src/
│
│   # Contracts and auxiliary Tact code
├── contracts/
│   ├── jetton-minter.tact
│   ├── jetton-wallet.tact
│   ├── messages.tact
│   └── constants.tact
│
│   # Tests
├── tests/
│   └── jetton.spec.ts
│
│   # Deployment script
├── scripts/
│   ├── contract.deploy.ts
│   └── contract.read.ts
│
│   # Miscellaneous utility things
└── utils/
```

Note that tests and the deployment script require the compiled contracts to be present in the `src/output` directory.

The configuration for the Tact compiler is in `tact.config.json` in the root of the repository. In most cases, you won't need to change this file.

## Smart Contracts Structure

The main smart contract is `jetton_minter.tact`, it imports `messages.tact` and `jetton_wallet.tact`. With the default configuration of `tact.config.json` targeting `jetton_minter.tact`, they're all compiled automatically.

### Inherited traits

Jetton Minter uses only _OwnableTransferable_, which is inherited from the _Ownable_ trait. Jetton Wallet only uses the _Ownable_ trait. All these traits come from the Tact's [standard libraries](https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/standard-libraries/).

Schemes of inheritance and imports:

```mermaid
graph LR
    B[jetton_minter.tact] -->|import| A[messages.tact]
    C[jetton_wallet.tact] -->|import| A[messages.tact]
    B[jetton_minter.tact] -->|import| C[jetton_wallet.tact]

    C[jetton_wallet.tact] -->|uses| E[ownable]
    B[jetton_minter.tact] -->|uses| F[ownableTransferable]
    F[ownableTransferable] -->|inherits| E[ownable]

    class E,F ownableStyle;

    classDef ownableStyle stroke-width:2,rx:25,ry:25;

```

Read more about those traits in the [Tact standard library](https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/standard-libraries/).

## Best Practices

- For guidance on interacting with Jettons using Tact, read the [Jetton cookbook](https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/jettons/).
- Be cautious of fake messages sent by scammers. Read [security best practices](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/security-best-practices/) to protect yourself from fraudulent activities.
- Always consult the [official Tact documentation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/) for additional resources and support.
